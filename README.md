# MemoryMatching
Since I lost the code for the original Memory Matching game that I made 2 years ago as a group, I decided to remake the game using the concepts I learnt ever since then as a throwback to simpler times. Surprisingly enough, I was able to condense all the code for the game mechanics into about 50 to 75 lines. 

NOTE: This version has no database connectivity since I felt it was quite pointless to implement it in a nostalgia piece. I might add it in at a later date since it's just 10 - 15 lines of code, apart from creating the database again using MySQL.
